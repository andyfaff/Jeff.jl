# Jeff.jl Documentation

Jeff is a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package for the analysis of neutron and X-ray reflectometry.
Currently, Jeff is being developed by [Andrew](#Authors) as a way to: 
1. Learn to program in Julia
2. Utilise more fully a probabilistic analysis paradigm for reflectometry

There is no promise of long-term support.
